# Comic Characters Ontology Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive ontology for comic book characters, their appearances in comics, the species they belong to, and the publishers involved. Utilizing Python's `rdflib` library, the project consolidates multiple datasets into a singular, informative knowledge graph that facilitates efficient data querying and exploration through SPARQL.

## Objectives
- To create a structured ontology that represents the intricate relationships and properties within the comic book universe.
- To enable easy organization, querying, and retrieval of detailed information about comic book entities.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- `rdflib` library for RDF manipulation and querying.
- SPARQL for data querying.
- GraphDB and Protégé for ontology validation and visualization.

## Dataset
The project integrates multiple datasets, including character details, their comic appearances, and related publishers, into a unified dataset. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed to ensure consistency and reliability.

## Ontology Creation
The ontology defines classes such as Character, Species, Publisher, and Comic, along with their relationships and properties, to capture the domain's complexity.

## Setup and Installation
Provide instructions on how to set up and run the project locally. Include steps for installing necessary libraries, setting up the environment, and any scripts to run.

## Usage
Detail how to use the application, including how to perform queries and interpret the results. Provide examples of SPARQL queries and their expected outcomes.

## Visualizations
Discuss the visual representations of the ontology, including class relationships, species categorization, and character attributes. Include any graphs or charts that help illustrate the ontology's structure.

## Conclusion
Summarize the project's impact on understanding and exploring the comic book domain, emphasizing the ontology's role in enhancing data accessibility and analysis.
